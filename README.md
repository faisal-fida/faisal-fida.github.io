This is my main website repository, located at [Portfolio](https://fasih4444.netlify.app). It contains details about my experience, skills, and projects. This project was started as a school assessment task in October 2019, and was built on from there! Before it used vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, but now it uses a combination of React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
